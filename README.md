# Talks

A central repository to store resources and talks.

Each talk should be stored in a separate folder which has at least a copy of the presentation but can additionally store any other extra resources you may feel are relevant (files, setup instructions, etc...)

The [github projects board](https://github.com/users/Waqar-ukaea/projects/3/views/1) should be used to propose new talks by adding a new issue to the proposals column. At minimum a title for the talk is obviously needed but a description can also be included. Others can react to the proposal giving an indication of which talks seem like the most popular ideas.
